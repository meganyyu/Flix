## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Current roadblock: I was not able to get UIActivityIndicatorView to appear - I'm not sure if it's that it doesn't load at all, or if it just doesn't appear for long enough compared to the process of fetching movie data. As an alternative, I was able to get MBProgressHUD to appear as a loading screen, but only by manually setting a delay. This is only really a temporary fix, so I plan to come back to this feature at a later time.
